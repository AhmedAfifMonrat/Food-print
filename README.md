# Food-print
A RESTful API which will collect the information of unused and leftover food items and distribute them to them in a sustainable approach to the society for mitigating food waste. 
Main IDEA:
1. A set of services that will gather information about left over or unused food, home grown vegetables and fruits from people of the city
2. Browse through the food items that take your fancy
3. Display information about Calories of the food item
4. Show the carbon footprint if the food goes for waste
5. Show interesting top rated recipes with the left over ingredients to avoid waste
